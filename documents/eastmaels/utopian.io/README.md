[Utopian.io](https://utopian.io) wants to reward Open Source contributors for their hard work. 
Forked from https://github.com/busyorg/busy, Utopian uses the [STEEM Blockchain](https://steem.io) to reward contributors in cryptocurrency.

Add the enviroment variable UTOPIAN_APP using the app name of your Steem Connect oauth application. You can create a SC app here https://v2.steemconnect.com/apps/create. The same app will have to be used and setup in the backend https://github.com/utopian-io/api.utopian.io.

### Run The Frontend
npm run dev-server


#### API Server
Our sister project [utopian-io/api.utopian.io](https://github.com/utopian-io/api.utopian.io) provides the back-end APIs for Utopian. If you want to run Utopian locally, you **do need**  to run that project, though you may want to check it out!
